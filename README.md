# SupervisedML
Python implementation of a simple Percepton, with randomized linear data, with inspiration of JS version by TheCodingTrain, and online documentation. The Percepton will start with randomly assigned weights and through the randomized 125 data sets, it will train itself to recognize an input point as either above or below the ideal model line.
